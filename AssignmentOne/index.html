						<h1>Fresh Flowers Online</h1>
						<p>
							Alongside the convenience of choosing flowers online, 
							and our fast and efficient flower delivery service, 
							all our flowers are fresh and nothing less than perfect is used for our flower delivery bouquets. 
							Our hand delivered gifts show care and thought.

						<p>
							We have florists all over the country so wherever you live, 
							or wherever they live, the order is sent to the closest local florist to the recipient. 
							This ensures minimal travel for the flowers and keeps them looking their best for longer. 
							In the event a delivery is attempted but not completed, 
							arrangements will be made to ensure the delivery is completed as soon and as safely as possible, 
							and a card will be left with details on how to arrange this.

							<h2>Beautiful Flowers Delivered</h2>
							<p>
								A flower delivery is more than a simple present, 
								to send flowers to someone is to send a beautiful gift but also to send your best wishes, 
								your kind thoughts and your thoughtful words. 
								For any occasion, having flowers delivered can make a special day remembered for years to come, 
								from welcoming a beautiful new addition to the family to congratulating that special someone on a fantastic new job or sending thank you flowers in appreciation of the help someone has given you that you couldn’t have managed without.
